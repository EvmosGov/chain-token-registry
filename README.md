# Evmos Chain and Token Registry

Welcome to Evmos Chain and Token Registry. Here you will find the requirements for submitting chain network and token registration. Please insure a chainConfig and token(s) are ready before submitting the governance proposal.

There are two folders: `tokens` and `chainConfig`. Inside `chainConfig`, network details should be filled out for mainnet and testnet (if available). As for the `tokens` folder, each token should have its own file and governance proposal.
